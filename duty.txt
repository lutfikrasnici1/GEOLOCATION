Create NodeJs API with these requirements:
1. Create CRUD endpoints for User
2. Add MongoDB connection and setup in NodeJS
2. Create User collection(schema) in MongoDB with properties like: FirstName, LastName, AddressLine1, City,Country, Latitude and Longitude.
3. For GET endpoints create ‘Get All Users ‘ endpoint and create ‘Get Near Users’ based on my location (my latitude,longitude)
4. When you create ‘Get Near Users’ endpoint the response from API should be users in that area like (100 meters )
5. When you create all of these tasks then you should be able to push the codebase to the Github, you can add your code as a public repository in Github
